# Fritzbox Bridge

Use your fritzbox as bridge and get access to all device sensors.<br>
Each sensor can be addressed individually and is synchronized via a single central query.

#### flow card/tags
* most sensor properties have auto trigger/action cards

#### supported devices:
* CometDECT, Fritz!DECT 300/301
* Fritz!DECT 200/210, FRITZ!Powerline 546E
* HANFUN Alarm
* FRITZ!Box

##### backward compatibility ( >= 0.5.0 )  
all devices that were paired before update will not be affected by device changes
only new paired devices will use the newest device version ( system limitation *sry )

#### tested device/sensor list:
* CometDECT
  * measurements have a delay ( max. 15min )
  * sending commands can take up to 15min to take effect
  * temperature sensor has higher resolution internal
  
#### Device TODO's
* driver: repeater
* functions: thermostat holidayactive + summeractive + nextchange, fritzbox statistics
* capabilities: energymeter measure_current

### History
